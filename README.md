## HW2

Implemented a decision tree based on entropy & info gain. 

## HW3

Implemented Bernoulli Naive Bayes model and Multinomial Naive Bayes. 

## HW4

Implemented KNN algorithm and chi-square calculator. 

## HW5

Implemented MaxEnt, including a model expectation calculator, an empirical  expectation calculator and a MaxEnt decoder for POS tagging.

## HW6

Improved MaxEnt decoder using Beam search.  

## HW7

Implemented Transformation Based Learning (TBL) algorithm.

## HW8

Implemented a SVM decoder which reads model file generated by libSVM.  Four kernels (linear, polynomial, rbf and sigmoid) are implemented.
